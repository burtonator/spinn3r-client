At any time it's possible for the API to issue the same document twice at different time intervals.

This is necessary because Spinn3r might receive updated metainfo (author, title, etc) , typo corrections by the author, or other changes.

Specifically, this method will be used in later versions of Spinn3r to ship additional features including recrawling content to detect updates of the page.
