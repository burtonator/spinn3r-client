## Why do i get "Error 500 Unsupported attempt to access lagged content"? ##

You have attempted to access data older than your account status allows, or it's older than two weeks. We do not index content for more than 2 weeks.


## When I try to register a source I get a message that says "Please contact support". Is my source registered? ##

No, unfortunately we occasionally have to manually register sources in order for them to be indexed properly. Please send an email to support@spinn3r.com to have your source registered.


## I don't see content from foo domain. ##

If you've just registered this source, please allow up to 24 hours for the site to be indexed. If you still don't see new content please contact support@spinn3r.com.


## Can I register a site without an rss feed? ##

Yes, but it requires manual intervention on our end. Please contact support@spinn3r.com to have it registered properly.


## When using your API i get a "402 payment required." What does that mean? ##

Your vendor code does not have permission to access our system. Please check to make sure the code you're using is correct, and if it does not work contact support@spinn3r.com.
