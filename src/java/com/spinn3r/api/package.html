    <h2>Java Spinn3r API Reference</h2>

    <p>
        This is the reference library for
        the <a href="http://spinn3r.com/documentation.php">Spinn3r client
        API</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It provides implementations for both the <code>feed.getDelta</code>
        and <code>feed.getPermalink</code> methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        This code was designed to be extremely portable to other langauges which
        should facilitate bindings in Java, Python, Lisp, Perl, Ruby, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Full API Support</h2>

    <p>
        This implementation also correctly handles all features of the API
        including all fields at the time it was shipped, throttling when no more
        results were found, pagination, gzip encoding, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>
        The reference API was designed to function without any external
        dependencies.  It uses the internal java.net.URL for HTTP transport and
        JAXP and DOM for parsing the XML results.
    </p>

    <h2>Portability</h2>

    <p>
        Right now this library requires JDK 1.5.  It should be easy to back port
        it to JDK 1.4 which we might do if we see a client request.
    </p>
