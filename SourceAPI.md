# Spinn3r Source API #

Spinn3r provides the ability to check on the status of a weblog in our index as well as register it for indexing and enumerating existing sources.

As Spinn3r expands we're no longer limited to weblogs but are not indexing forums, memetrackers, classified advertising sites, and other types of dynamic and social metadata.

## Available Methods ##

  * [source.list](SourceListAPI.md) - list the weblogs published by Spinn3r.
  * [source.status](SourceStatusAPI.md) - check on the status of an existing source.
  * [source.register](SourceRegisterAPI.md) - register a new source.

See SourceFields for more documentation on response values.
