# Introduction #

All our language codes are ISO 639 two letter lang codes. We use the special lang code of U when we are unable to determine the language from the underlying text - usually because we don't have enough data.

Chinese language support can be difficult to determine because of the fact that Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text have overlapping character codes. If the document is ambiguous we return cjk to denote that it's at least one of these langauges. If the classifier is certain it will return ja for Japanese, ko for Korean or zh for Chinese.
