# Introduction #

Returns full HTML content for all sources in our index. This also includes our content extract support  which allows our users to skip indexing chrome within HTML posts.

Each item is the full HTML of a permalink published by a site in our index.

Each time we visit a site we fingerprint URLs on the front page and only crawl new URLs. We also crawl every URL found via RSS and Atom feeds.
